Easily manage and create 301 redirects for your Wordpress website. A robust interface allows you create and validate redirecs.

== Description ==

**EPS 301 Redirects?** helps you manage and create 301 redirects for your Wordpress website. A robust interface allows you to select the *Destination URL* from drop down menus, and validates your redirects for troubleshooting.


**What is a 301 Redirect?** 
A redirect is a simple way to re-route traffic coming to a *Requested URL* to different *Destination URL*. 

A 301 redirect indicates that the page requested has been permanently moved to the *Destination URL*, and helps pass on the *Requested URLs* traffic in a search engine friendly manner. Creating a 301 redirect tells search engines that the *Requested URL*  has moved permanently, and that the content can now be found on the *Destination URL*. An important feature is that search engines will pass along any clout the *Requested URL* used to have to the *Destination URL*.


**When Should I use EPS 301 Redirects?** 
1. Replacing an old site design with a new site design
1. Overhauling or re-organizing your existing Wordpress content


**Features**

* Overhauling or re-organizing your existing Wordpress content
